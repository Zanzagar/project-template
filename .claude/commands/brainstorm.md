# Brainstorm: $ARGUMENTS.topic

## Phase 1: Problem Understanding

First, let me make sure I understand what we're exploring:

**Topic:** $ARGUMENTS.topic

**Clarifying questions** (answer any that apply):
1. What problem does this solve?
2. Who is the user/audience?
3. What constraints exist (time, tech stack, compatibility)?
4. What does success look like?

## Phase 2: Divergent Thinking

Generate multiple distinct approaches without judging yet:

### Approach A: [Name]
- **Concept:** [One-sentence description]
- **How it works:** [Brief explanation]
- **Key insight:** [What makes this approach unique]

### Approach B: [Name]
- **Concept:** [One-sentence description]
- **How it works:** [Brief explanation]
- **Key insight:** [What makes this approach unique]

### Approach C: [Name]
- **Concept:** [One-sentence description]
- **How it works:** [Brief explanation]
- **Key insight:** [What makes this approach unique]

## Phase 3: Evaluation Matrix

| Criteria | Approach A | Approach B | Approach C |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Simplicity | | | |
| Maintainability | | | |
| Performance | | | |
| Time to implement | | | |
| Flexibility | | | |

## Phase 4: Recommendation

**Recommended approach:** [A/B/C]

**Reasoning:**
- [Why this approach wins]
- [What trade-offs we're accepting]
- [What risks to watch for]

**Next steps if approved:**
1. [First concrete action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]

**Shall I proceed with this approach, or would you like to explore any alternatives further?**
